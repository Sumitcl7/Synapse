Cloud Native Microservices Application


Project Description
This project is a cloud-native microservices application built to demonstrate a modern, scalable, and resilient software architecture. The application is a [briefly describe your application, e.g., "simple e-commerce platform that handles product management and user authentication"]. It showcases my proficiency with microservices, containerization, orchestration, and cloud deployment.
Core Features
• User Management Service: Handles user authentication, registration, and profile management.
• Product/Post Management Service: Manages the creation, retrieval, and updates of [products/posts].
• Inter-Service Communication: Services communicate via a REST API.
• Docker Containerization: Each service is containerized for portability and consistent deployment.
• Kubernetes Orchestration: Deployed on a Kubernetes cluster for automated management and scaling.
• CI/CD Pipeline: A [e.g., GitHub Actions] pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process.
Technology Stack
Languages:
• Python
Frameworks & Libraries:
• [e.g., Flask/FastAPI for services]
• [e.g., SQLAlchemy for ORM]
• [e.g., Pytest for testing]
Infrastructure & Tools:
• Containerization: Docker
• Container Orchestration: Kubernetes
• Cloud Platform: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
• Infrastructure as Code: [e.g., Terraform]
• CI/CD: [e.g., GitHub Actions]
• Database: [e.g., PostgreSQL]
Architecture Overview
The application is structured as a series of independent microservices. Each service has its own database and is responsible for a specific domain. Communication between services is handled via REST API calls. The entire application is containerized using Docker and managed by Kubernetes, which handles service discovery, load balancing, and scaling. The services are deployed to AWS on an EKS cluster, and the entire infrastructure is defined as code.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
• Git
• Docker
• Kubernetes (Minikube/Docker Desktop for local, or an AWS EKS cluster for cloud deployment)
• [e.g., Python 3.9+]
• [e.g., Terraform]
