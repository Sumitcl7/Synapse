🚀 Synapse – Azure DevOps & AKS Project
📌 Overview

Synapse is an end-to-end Azure DevOps & Cloud-Native project demonstrating Infrastructure as Code (IaC), containerization, CI/CD readiness, and Kubernetes deployment on Microsoft Azure.

The project provisions Azure infrastructure using Terraform, containerizes a microservice using Docker, stores images securely in Azure Container Registry (ACR), deploys workloads to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and exposes services publicly using an Azure LoadBalancer.

🚀 Key Features

Infrastructure provisioning using Terraform modules

Secure container image management with ACR

AKS–ACR integration using Managed Identity

Kubernetes Deployment & Service manifests

Public service exposure using LoadBalancer

Cost-optimized temporary AKS provisioning

💰 Cost Optimization

AKS was provisioned temporarily for validation and decommissioned after testing to prevent unnecessary cloud costs.
